                        <p>The world has moved with a paradigmatic shift in terms of buying and selling and online
                            marketplaces have become an integral part of our lives. Just from the convenience of the
                            palm you order and they deliver right at the doorsteps, and of course, everything made
                            possible by technology and the techno transitions as a whole.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From health care products to utility services, everything in the present day is being
                            consumed through the online realms and the show doesnâ€™t stop here, the concept of near me
                            availability has led to geographically restricted specific places that have given rise to
                            potential market places willing to offer goods and services to prospective customers on the
                            lookout for products or services they wish to purchase.



                        </p>
                        <p>And this is what has led to a boom in online hyperlocal marketplaces, vying to serve the
                            local segments and bridge the gap vis- a- vis national and global online market deliveries
                            or market places.



                        </p>

                        <p>Service deliverance at the local level is catching pace with many portals catering to the
                            local sellers, willing to explore the potentials of additional channels in terms of boosting
                            sales and buyers shopping from the convenience of their palm, in a way harnessing the
                            benefits of the mobility era and so on.




                        </p>

                        <p>The pandemic era as one would say has further accentuated the need for local e market places
                            that could suffice the needs of a range of customers looking for different products, goods,
                            and services to be delivered to them through orders and transactions based on their
                            fingertips.



                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, an Online Marketplace automates and streamlines the buy and sell processes
                            through a dedicated portal, where vendors sell their products directly to the consumers, so
                            the prospects of serving new customers apart from the existing ones are very much increased,
                            and with selling redefined the sluggish process of stock movement and distribution is
                            replaced by swifter and faster movement of goods or products which in general leads to
                            additional revenue on a regular basis.



                        </p>


                        <p>One such portal is Nipige, a rapid business digitization platform and an e market place that
                            caters to the needs of the B2B and B2C segments of the hyper-local market space, with
                            features that make it a boon for both the vendors and the customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>Nipige can ensure faster onboarding of vendors with a host of features that relate to
                            products and services management, order management, shopping cart management, performance
                            and analytical tools, payment gateway management, hosting, security management, and many
                            more.



                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What more, the app facilitates tenant-based multilingual interface for ease of trade and
                            purchase and has been developed keeping in view several of the challenges that local vendors
                            and customers face when being part of an online marketplace.
