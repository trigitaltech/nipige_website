                        <p>Portals have started catering to infinite business segments and sectors in a way as to
                            broaden the scope of buying and selling. The reason is simple, how many apps should an
                            individual shuffle across for various needs whether it is selling or buying. Utility
                            services one app, groceries another app, so on and the list may be endless.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The need of the day is a singular app or a portal that can comprehensively serve to be of a
                            marketplace and a digitalization platform for different businesses, or a marketplace for
                            all, that can attend to the needs of multiple business sellers and buyers, more so in the
                            hyper-local segments, where the diversity of individual businesses is broad and unorganized.




                        </p>
                        <p>A marketplace for all consolidates various businesses, vendors from diverse business groups
                            onto a singular platform enabling, vendors to develop business networks and sell their goods
                            or services from one platform, one infrastructure or a portal that helps reach across
                            customers with varying needs across multiple segments of different goods and services.




                        </p>

                        <p>E-commerce giants across the globe have recorded phenomenal success by doing so i.e. catering
                            to multiple business segments from one singlehood and enabling sellers sell products of
                            different nature and similarly, buyers buy products of different sorts from a common
                            marketplace as it is.




                        </p>

                        <p>And the hyper-local sectors cannot be excluded from the online panorama, with people
                            increasingly adapting to the online means and methods for several of their needs there
                            exists a greater potential in the demand for locale-based products and services that relate

                            for everything big and small with the delivery at the doorsteps. So forth the ability to
                            shuffle across goods and services from a common platform has driven the concept of a market
