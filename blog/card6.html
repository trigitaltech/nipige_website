                        <p>Small-time businesses, more so with the business conduct being on an offline model, have
                            their own challenges - the foremost amongst them being, losing customers in the
                            ever-competitive world of proliferating online markets and the inability to be visible to a
                            large spectrum of prospects who are potential customers in the long run.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Businesses often wish to be online and be part of "catalog of catalog" portals to gain the
                            much-needed business visibility they deserve, something unthinkable for individual business
                            proprietor models or individual vendor catalog business models.
                        </p>
                        <p>Social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and so on have been attending to the same
                            with face book shops venting out the urge to be part of the online market realms.
                        </p>

                        <p>A gamut of businesses big and small have been struggling to get online, and as it would, as
                            is the necessity, a lot of marketplaces have been sprouting up with distinctive features and
                            functions of their own, where small-time business proprietors can list their goods and
                            services beyond their own proprietary modeled website or an e-commerce application.
                        </p>

                        <p>The better part is a marketplace can accommodate with ease such vendors as is the very motive
                            and function of the portals developed for the purpose as such â€“Multi-vendor online platforms
                            and e market places that can facilitate orders, payments, and credit payments, manage
                            inventory to name a few could provide a new channel of business conduct and streamline
                            several of the business processes with digitalized orchestrations and that apart also
                            increase network-based business visibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>And what more Omnichannel selling helps increase revenue with significance and effect unheard
                            of before. Products and services are accessed better, hence the business prospects have
                            enhanced propositions, definitely a game-changer for small-time businesses with a sea of
                            visible change being brought about along with the passing times as would be the need be for.
                        </p>


                        <p>The absence or lack of online markets or mediums could visibly hamper the prospects of
                            small-time businesses or vendors. Conventionally small-time businesses or sellers intending
                            to go online on their own, need to invest, operate and maintain their own portal or website.
                        </p>
                        <p>And the ability to generate revenue merely by an online presence is further subjugated by
                            varying conditions that pertain to business visibility, network, customer reach, etc and as
                            would the variables determine the scope of business is compromised owing to lack of business
                            visibility and network, an outcome resultant of operating "on own network" business model.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the other hand, online marketplaces offer greater visibility, well-connected networks
                            with broader customer bases, and above all cost-effectively, where the major cost being
                            onboarding the platform alone without the need for ownership, maintenance, and operational
                            costs that would have been incurred in the conventional model of an e-commerce website.
                            Nipige, as a hyper-local e-marketplace can enable small, medium scale vendors sell their
                            products, goods, and services better and facilitate Easy Acquire, Sell, and Deliver. Nipige:
